# The core logic of the publisher application will be as follows
# (1) The publisher app decides which all topics it is going to publish.
# We don't care for the values for the topic being published (any
# arbitrary value for that topic is fine)
#
# (2) the application obtains a handle to the broker (which under the
# hood will be a proxy object but the application doesn't know it is a
# proxy).  Moreover, here I am assuming that the lookup and broker are
# lumped together. Else you need to get the lookup service and then
# ask the lookup service to send a representation of the broker
#
# (3) Register with the lookup/broker letting it know all the topics it is publishing
# and any other details needed for the underlying middleware to make the
# communication happen via ZMQ
#
# (4) Obtain a handle to the publisher object (which maybe a specialized
# object depending on whether it is using the direct dissemination or
# via broker approach)
#
# (5) Wait for a kickstart msg from the broker. This is when the publisher knows
# that all subscribers are ready and that it is time for publishers to start
# publishing.
#
# (6) Start a loop on the publisher object for sending of topics
#
#       In each iteration, the app decides (randomly) on which all
#       topics it is going to publish, and then accordingly invokes
#       the publish method of the publisher object passing the topic
#       and its value. 
#
#       Note that additional info like timestamp etc may also need to
#       be sent and the whole thing serialized under the hood before
#       actually sending it out.
#
#
# (6) When the loop terminates, possibly after a certain number of
# iterations of publishing are over, proceed to clean up the objects and exit
#
